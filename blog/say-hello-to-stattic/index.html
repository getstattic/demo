        <p>Welcome to <strong>Stattic</strong>, the lightweight, modern, static site generator that's decentralizing publishing and putting the power to create websites back into the hands of the community creating them.</p>
<p>If you've ever been frustrated with the sluggishness, archaic architecture and endless database queries of traditional content management systems, then Stattic is here to offer a better way forward.</p>
<h2>What is Stattic?</h2>
<p>Stattic is a <strong>static site generator** designed for developers, content creators, and anyone who values <strong>speed<strong>, **simplicity</strong>, and </strong>security</strong> in their website builds.</p>
<p>Take your content, process it with modern templating, and output pure <strong>static HTML<strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and </strong>JavaScript</strong> files that can be deployed anywhere – from simple web hosts to CDNs like GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, or countless others.</p>
<h3>Why Stattic?</h3>
<p>Users demand <strong>speed** and **reliability</strong>, which is what Stattic excels at. While CMS based websites fall victim to slow database calls, bloated plugins, and constant security patches, Stattic keeps things lean and mean.</p>
<p>Here's what you can expect when you build with Stattic:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Blazing Fast Page Loads</strong></h3>
<p>With Stattic, you can forget about slow load times. Don't take my word for it though, <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-demo-stattic-site/04ku4kp8kj?form_factor=desktop">see for yourself</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://stattic.site">Stattic</a> sites are <strong>static HTML</strong> at their core, meaning no server-side rendering or database calls are needed.</p>
<p>Every page is pre-rendered and ready to be served instantly, resulting in blazing fast page loads. Say goodbye to that dreaded <strong>&quot;waiting for the database&quot;</strong> delay that can leave your visitors hanging.</p>
<h3>2. <strong>No Database, No Problem</strong></h3>
<p>Databases are great until they aren't. When they go down, get corrupted, or become a security vulnerability, your entire site - and reputation - can go with them. Stattic doesn't need a database at all, effectively making SQL attacks null.</p>
<p>That's right, your site is pure <strong>static files</strong> – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This means less to go wrong while you receive more reliability, especially under high traffic.</p>
<h3>3. <strong>Modern, Clean Code</strong></h3>
<p>Stattic leverages modern web development practices like templating with <strong>Jinja2</strong>, a Python-powered templating engine. Your templates stay clean, reusable, and easy to maintain.</p>
<p>You can apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles to your layout, making design changes effortless across your site.</p>
<h3>4. <strong>Security as a Standard</strong></h3>
<p>By removing the need for dynamic server-side rendering and databases, you eliminate a huge number of potential attack vectors.</p>
<p>Stattic websites are inherently more secure because there are no moving parts that can be exploited by hackers. No more worrying about outdated plugins or surprise security vulnerabilities that can make your CMS powered site a target.</p>
<h3>5. <strong>Flexibility with Zero Bloat</strong></h3>
<p>If you've ever worked with any CMS software, you know how quickly things can get bloated with unused plugins, themes, and database tables.</p>
<p>Stattic is different.</p>
<p>It's lightweight and only includes what you need. If you want to integrate a new feature, you simply add it to the codebase – no plugins required, no bloat added.</p>
<h3>6. <strong>Fully Customizable</strong></h3>
<p>Stattic gives you full control over every aspect of your website.</p>
<p>Need custom fonts? With Stattic's <code>--fonts</code> option, you can download and include any Google Fonts you like.</p>
<p>Want a clean and efficient build process? Use the <code>--minify</code> flag to compress all your CSS and JavaScript into optimized single files, reducing load times and improving performance.</p>
<p>Here's a quick example of how easy it is to build your site with Stattic:</p>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><code>python3 stattic.py --output=output --minify --fonts=&quot;Lato,Montserrat&quot;
</code></pre><p>In one simple command, Stattic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Builds your site into the output folder.</li>
<li>Minifies your CSS and JS files for faster load times.</li>
<li>Downloads and includes the Lato and Montserrat fonts for use in your design.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Hosting Freedom</h3>
<p>Since Stattic outputs static files, you're not tied down to any specific hosting provider.</p>
<p>You can deploy your Stattic site anywhere – GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, traditional servers - virtually anywhere.</p>
<p>No need to pay for heavy managed hosting like some other platforms force you into.</p>
<h3>8. No More Updates Breaking Your Site</h3>
<p>How many times has an update caused something to break on your site? It's a never-ending cycle of patching, fixing, and hoping nothing crashes.</p>
<p>Stattic is simple: once your site is built, there's no moving parts to update or break. <em>It just works</em>.</p>
<h2>Ready to Try Stattic?</h2>
<p>If you're ready to leave behind the heavy and try something more modern and efficient, Stattic is here for you.</p>
<p>Whether you're a developer looking for a clean and customizable solution or a small business owner who just wants a fast and secure website, Stattic will get you there with less hassle.</p>
